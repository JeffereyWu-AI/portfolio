## Projects
### Spaceship Titanic: Predicting Passenger Fate with Machine Learning 
_A Kaggle competition that required predicting which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension._
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Uncovered patterns in missing values, passenger demographics, and spending habits on the spaceship.
- **Feature Engineering** – Engineered new features such as family grouping, cabin location, and spending behavior to enhance model performance.
- **Model Selection & Optimization** – Implemented and fine-tuned powerful classifiers, including XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, using Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation.
- **Threshold Tuning for Class Imbalance** – Optimized classification thresholds to align predicted probabilities with real-world class distribution.
